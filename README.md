# 🚀 Abstract
The Home Rent Service Website is a web-based platform designed to simplify the rental
process for houses, stores, and car parking spaces. The system focuses on area-based
rental services where property owners can update rental information and users can easily
search for available properties. Each listing includes important details such as pictures, rent
amount, facilities, and location. This project aims to reduce manual effort, save time, and
provide reliable and updated rental information through a user-friendly web interface.
